# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance structure for projects in this organization.

## Project Roles

### Maintainer
- Has write access to the repository
- Reviews and merges pull requests
- Manages releases and project direction
- Responds to issues and discussions

### Contributor
- Submits pull requests and bug reports
- Participates in discussions
- Helps with documentation and testing
- Follows the Code of Conduct and Contributing guidelines

### Community Member
- Uses the project
- Reports bugs and suggests features
- Participates in discussions

## Decision Making Process

### Minor Changes
Minor changes including bug fixes, documentation updates, and small feature improvements can be approved and merged by any maintainer.

### Major Changes
Major changes that affect the project's architecture, API, or direction require:
1. Opening an issue or discussion for proposal
2. Community feedback period (minimum 7 days)
3. Consensus among maintainers
4. Clear documentation of the decision

### Consensus Building
- Decisions are made through consensus when possible
- If consensus cannot be reached, the project maintainer makes the final decision
- All decisions should be documented in the relevant issue or pull request

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have shown dedication to the project through consistent contributions, helpful reviews, and community engagement may be invited to become maintainers. The process typically involves:

1. Consistent contribution history (code, documentation, or community support)
2. Understanding of the project's goals and codebase
3. Positive interactions with the community
4. Invitation from existing maintainer(s)

## Code of Conduct

All participants in this project are expected to follow the Code of Conduct. Violations should be reported to the project maintainers.

## Changes to Governance

This governance model can be modified through the major change process described above. Proposals for governance changes should be discussed openly with the community.
