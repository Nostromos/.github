# Default Community Health Files

This repository contains the default community health files that apply to all repositories in this GitHub account. These files help establish consistent community guidelines, contribution processes, and project governance across all projects.

## What's Included

- **Code of Conduct** - Guidelines for community interactions and expected behavior
- **Contributing Guidelines** - Instructions for how to contribute to projects
- **Issue Templates** - Standardized templates for bug reports, feature requests, and other issues
- **Pull Request Template** - Standard template for pull request descriptions
- **License** - Default licensing terms for projects. 

> [!WARNING]
> You cannot create a default license file. License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded. I'm including it here because I store all my community health file templates here.

## How It Works

GitHub automatically uses these files as defaults for any repository that doesn't have its own versions. This ensures consistency across all projects while allowing individual repositories to override with their own specific files when needed.
